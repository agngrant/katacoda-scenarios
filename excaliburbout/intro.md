# First Steps in BOUT++

BOUT++ is `insert good description`.

This software will help with `write something intelligent`.

Starting out with it can be daunting - this is part of a series of tutorials to aid in getting to grips with BOUT++ - from installing and setting it up to using it in some simulations.

The first step will be to do a sandbox compilation in a Docker container to start to get use to what steps are needed for compiling the software.

You will go through the following steps:

- Creating a Dockerfile
- Building a Docker image
- Running the Image
- Compiling BOUT++
- Running Examples
