# First Steps in BOUT++

Officially this is the description of BOUT++

>BOUT++ is a framework for writing fluid and plasma simulations in curvilinear geometry. It is intended to be quite modular, with a variety of numerical methods and >time-integration solvers available. BOUT++ is primarily designed and tested with reduced plasma fluid models in mind, but it can evolve any number of equations, with >equations appearing in a readable form.
>Jointly developed by University of York (UK), LLNL, CCFE, DCU, DTU, and other international partners.

BOUT++ is `insert more accessible description`.

This software will help with `write something intelligent - ask Amy/Anna/Elena/Jacob/Johnny/Moritz`.

Starting out with it can be daunting - this is part of a series of tutorials to aid in getting to grips with BOUT++ - from installing and setting it up to using it in some simulations.

The first step will be to do a sandbox compilation in a Docker container to start to get use to what steps are needed for compiling the software.

You will go through the following steps:

- Creating a Dockerfile
- Building a Docker image
- Running the Image
- Compiling BOUT++
- Running Examples

## Where to Run

You can run the commands in the sandbox terminal in the browser or you can run them on your local machine/VM/cloud platform.

Requirements to run:

- Docker Version 18+
