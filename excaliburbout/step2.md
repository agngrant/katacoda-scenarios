# Building a Docker Image

Before we can compile the BOUT++ code, we need to create a Docker image which we can run.

Run the following command to start the build image process:

`docker build . -t bout`{{execute}}

The process for the build will take anywhere from 3 to 20 minutes depending on network conditions.

Check your image has been created and tagged with the tag bout.

`docker images`{{execute}}

This should display an output with your image contained in a list similar to this:

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY         TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
bout               latest    98804a227678   About a minute ago   688MB

mysql              latest    2fe463762680   3 months ago         514MB
alpine             latest    14119a10abf4   4 months ago         5.59MB
weaveworks/scope   1.11.4    a082d48f0b39   2 years ago          78.5MB
```

Now that you have built the image - it is time to move on to running the image.
